It allows you to view each individual's name, email, and identification number while also providing GitHub profiles for Engineers, education from Interns, and office numbers from Managers.

## Usage

You will be prompted a series of questions about basic information for each team member and their role in the development team. There will be a point where you will be asked if you would like to add another team member or create your Team Profile. This cycle will continue until you have added all team members and want to create your landing page. This should be used to organize your team members on start up, if there are any adjustments, and promotions.
